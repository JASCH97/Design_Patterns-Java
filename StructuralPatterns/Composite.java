/* 
When we need to create a structure in a way that the objects in the structure has to 
be treated the same way, we can apply composite design pattern. Lets understand it 
with a real life example - A diagram is a structure that consists of Objects such as 
Circle, Lines, Triangle etc. When we fill the drawing with color (say Red), the same 
color also gets applied to the Objects in the drawing. Here drawing is made up of 
different parts and they all have same operations. Composite Pattern consists of 
following objects.

- Base Component: is the interface for all objects in the composition, client program 
  uses base component to work with the objects in the composition. It can be an interface 
  or an abstract class with some methods common to all the objects.
- Leaf: Defines the behaviour for the elements in the composition. It is the building block 
  for the composition and implements base component. It doesnâ€™t have references to other 
  Components.
- Composite: It consists of leaf elements and implements the operations in base component.
